abstract = {A simple failure model is used to derive a bivariate exponential distribution. This distribution, although well known in the literature, does not appear to have been considered in a reliability context. Its properties are considered and in particular explicit expressions are obtained for the distributions of the larger and of the smaller of a pair of correlated exponential observations. The results are compared with those obtained by Marshall and Olkin (1967a, b) for a different bivariate exponential model motivated by reliability theory.

The approach will be based on some results of the theory of extreme values over a threshold. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the distribution of the flood volume in partial duration series analysis of flood phenomena, by using a bivariate exponential distribution of discharge exceedances and durations over a base level. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Copulas have become a popular tool in multivariate modeling successfully applied in many fields. A good open-source implementation of copulas is much needed for more practitioners to enjoy the joy of copulas. This article presents the design, features, and some implementation details of the R package copula. The package provides a carefully designed and easily extensible platform for multivariate modeling with copulas in R. S4 classes for most frequently used elliptical copulas and Archimedean copulas are implemented, with methods for density/distribution evaluation, random number generation, and graphical display. Fitting copula-based models with maximum likelihood method is provided as template examples. With the classes and methods in the package, the package can be easily extended by user-defined copulas and margins to solve problems.},

abstract = {The mean and variance of storm surface runoff are derived under the assumption that storm events are rectangular pulses with a bivariate exponential distribution for the intensity and duration of the storm. The Philip infiltration equation is used to make the transformation between rainfall and surface runoff. The probability of zero storm surface runoff is also calculated under the same assumptions. It is shown that the correlation between intensity and duration of the storm has an important impact on the probabilistic structure of storm surface runoff.
