Title: Moran-Downton Bivariate Exponential Distribution (MDBED)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Luis F. Duque <lfduquey@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Luis F. Duque <lfduquey@gamail.com>
Description: Through several functions, this package provides 3D plots of the Moran-Downton bivariate Exponential 
  distribution (BED), generates bivariate random values, and also provides values of the joint and conditional PDFs and CDFs. 
  The MDBED can be used to represent the joint distribution of: i) the interarrival and service time 
  of a single-server queueing system, ii) the lengths of successive time intervals, iii) hydrological quantities as a streamflow at 
  two points on a river or rainfall at two locations, iv) intensity and duration of a storm of rainfall, v) height and period of water waves, 
  vi) successive wave heights, and vii) peak flows and their forecasts.
